		<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>I am a finance professional currently living in Atlanta, GA. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I am looking to transition from the finance world into a more creative space, as that is my true passion. I received my degree from the University of Georgia in Economics, but have recently had the epiphany that there is value in honoring my desire to switch career paths, and this is the first step in that journey.</p>

		<h2>My Mission</h2>
			<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a branding consultant for creative entrepreneurs. The Atlanta market is rich with creative community looking to effectively market their craft; it is my goal to manage branding strategy for SMB entrepreneurs who do not possess the skill set to create comprehensive branding [social media presence, logo/web design, and email marketing].</p>

		<h2>My Experience</h2>
			<p>This is how I've evolved professionally:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Team Loan Officer,</strong> PrimeLending, a Plains Capital Company<br>
				<em>Atlanta, GA, 2012-Present</em></li>
				<li><strong>Development Coordinator,</strong> Atlanta Hawks and Philips Arena [Atlanta Spirit, LLC]<br>
				<em>Atlanta, GA, 2011-2012</em></li> 
			</ul>

		<h2>Education</h2>
			<p>Bachelor of Science, Consumer Economics</p> 
			<p><em>University of Georgia, 2008-2012</em></p>

		<h2>Other</h2>
